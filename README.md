# tictactoe

## Overview
This tic tac toe game was wrote shortly after I finished my Information Structures with Python course. It is a simple logical program that doesn't involve any complex data structure but a nested list. Therefore, after I understood the logics of how to score the game, I wrote the entire program based out of how I like to play the game. With that, I added many details to increase user experience.

## User Interaction

### Duplicate placement
From the user experience perspective, I made sure to handle duplicate placement more interactive as below:
